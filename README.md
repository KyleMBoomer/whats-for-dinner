# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
I built an app that provides users with the ability to randomly generate suggestions for meals. It features sides, desserts, main dishes, and an option to produce all three at once for an entire meal. If the user attempts to generate a meal suggestion without selecting one of the four aforementioned options, they will be prompted to do so. 

### Installation Instructions:
1. Go to the GitHub repo for this app: www.github.com/kylemboomer/whats-for-dinner.
2. Fork and clone the repo onto your machine. 
3. Open the HTML file in the repo and have fun creating food suggestions!

### Preview of App:


### Context:
I'm a Mod 1 Front End student, and this was my second solo project. It took me about seven hours to build. 

### Contributors:
Solo project. Here's my GitHub: www.github.com/kylemboomer

### Learning Goals:
What's For Dinner? provided a valuable exprerience in starting from scratch with three different languages. To wit: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I was directed to write every line of code in the project, and am proud of the result. 

### Wins + Challenges:
Win: I found the JavaScript requisite to fulfill the necessary iterations very intuitive. It didn't take me long to have every line of JS in my project written. 

Challenge: The display took me much longer. I'd never used a few of the CSS properties needed (background-image, opacity, among others) to achieve the comp display, so most of the time I spent on this project was getting that figured out. But I think it looks great, and I'm happy with the result.
